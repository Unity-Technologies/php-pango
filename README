This is the start of a Pango binding for PHP. Current requirements are:

* PHP 5.2+
* Pango 1.20+ though this will likely change to a lower version when I've done
  some research on it
* pecl/cairo. Currently the only functionality I'm wrapping are those required
  to make Cairo rendering work which will suit my own purposes - however, once 
  that works I intend to remove the hard dependency here if I can.

Once this gets up to something usable it will be proposed for PECL.
